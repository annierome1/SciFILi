A combination of different data and algorithms to create a Library lookup program 

Program that uses BinaryTree, LinkedList, and Priority Queue to create a book library based off of books from a txt file

BinaryTree was used to search for a book title, find book to be checked in/out, and find books by a certain author. Binary Search trees are a fast way to search for data, especially larger data sets which is why it was used

LinkedList was used to store books that contained author being searched for. Books were appended to the LinkedList and the LinkedList was returned. LL was used as it is an easy way to store data and link data together.

Priority Queue was used to sort through the data and return the books in order of highest priority(1) to lowest priority(108). PQs are great ways to sort hierarchal data.
